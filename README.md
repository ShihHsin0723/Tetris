CSC258 Final Course Project

A Tetris game developed by completely using assembly code with the following features:
- Sound effects for rotating, shifting, and dropping tetrominoes
- The choices of pause and restart game actions for the player
- All 7 types of tetrominoes were implemented, each with a different colour
